## Clean Code & Good Documentation

- Excellent readme. Clearly laid out the why and how for this project. Providing explanations for assumptions
- Overall, great job creating functions in individual py files. 
- Doc strings, inline coding and markdown cells throughout the notebooks and pyfiles made it extremely easy to follow.

## Proper Data Science:

- FuzzyWuzzy, glad to see you where able to figure out the fuzzywuzzy package. 
- Ensembling- very good job working through the individual models before ensembling. 
- Feature Engineering- Adjusted TV Market Value, loved the thought for this feature-I know it did not greatly 
  impact the model but brings up the "Devin Booker" effect. 
  
## Comments:

- Ian, great work job on project 3. Appears you are becoming more and more comfotable with creating clean and concise code
- Using your domain knowledge for this project really allowed you to dive deeper into data science concepts. Continue to think beyond the original data :)
- Please continue to work on this project post bootcamp. You have great ideas for future work.
